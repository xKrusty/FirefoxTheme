# Krusty's Firefox Theme

### Setup
1. Enable Settings (in about:config):
```
    toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets	(to enable userChrome and userContent)
    svg.context-properties.content.enabled 		(to allow custom colors on imported svg from this folder)
	(without it Firefox only allows using svg context-* properties on images that are loaded from chrome:// and resource:// urls.)
```

```
Menu > Help > Troubleshooting Information > (Open) Profile Folder
or: about:support > (Open) Profile Folder
```
